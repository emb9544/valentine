# Copilot Instructions for Valentine Project

## Project Overview
This is a minimal HTML-based project with a single entry point (`main.html`). The project appears to be a Valentine's Day-themed application or webpage.

## Architecture
- **Entry Point**: `main.html` - The main HTML document
- **Structure**: Currently a basic HTML skeleton with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<body>` tags

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- **Single-file design**: All content is contained in `main.html`
- **Markup-based**: Uses standard HTML with potential for CSS/JavaScript enhancement

## Development Workflow
- **No build system**: Direct file editing - changes take effect immediately when opened in a browser
- **Testing**: Open `main.html` directly in a web browser to preview changes

## File Structure
```
valentine/
└── main.html          # Main HTML file with page structure
```

## Quick Start for Contributors
1. Edit `main.html` to add content (HTML markup, embedded CSS, or JavaScript)
2. Test by opening the file in a web browser
3. Ensure valid HTML5 structure is maintained

## Common Tasks
- **Add content**: Edit the `<body>` section in `main.html`
- **Style elements**: Add `<style>` tags in `<head>` section
- **Add interactivity**: Embed `<script>` tags or link external JavaScript files
